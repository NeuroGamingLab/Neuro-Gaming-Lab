# Neuro Gaming Lab

Neurogaming Lab is an AI engineering and research initiative focused on rejuvenating classic and legacy arcade games with modern machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques.

We reimagine old-school games as living environments—where intelligent agents learn, adapt, and evolve through play. By embedding deep neural networks into retro and contemporary game engines, we transform static gameplay into dynamic, learning-driven systems: adaptive NPCs, self-improving opponents, autonomous players, and AI-assisted game mechanics.

Our work bridges game preservation and innovation, treating classic arcade titles not as relics, but as ideal testbeds for experimentation in decision-making, control, and emergent behavior. From pixel-based environments to modern simulators, Neurogaming Lab explores how learning agents can master, modify, and meaningfully interact with games across generations.

At its core, Neurogaming Lab is where nostalgia meets intelligence—reviving the past to build the future of playable AI.
